This project presents the implementation of a web-based platform for facilitating and managing car maintenance and repair services. 
Garage Glide is an automotive service provider that offers a range of functionalities for both their customers and staff. 
The primary objective is to provide a seamless and efficient experience for both car owners and the auto repair shop staff. 

The past project focused on allowing customers choose and book from a range of local garages on their website. 
We took the main functionalities offered in that project and also scouted for similar platforms on google. 
The closest system to what we wanted was from Halfords, a leading provider of cycling, motoring services, 
vehicle servicing and repairs. 

We did not have access to the past project; however, we went off the brief overview of the functionalities it offered. 
Some of the functionalities include: 
* Viewing details of repair services
* Feedback provision.
* Allows garages to manage customers and bookings.
* Staff can view details of services on cars.
We took inspiration from these functionalities and integrated them into our system
